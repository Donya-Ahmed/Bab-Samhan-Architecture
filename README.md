# Bab Samhan - Frontend Architecture

## Overview
This project represents a **frontend architecture** implementation designed and developed to provide a clear, scalable, and maintainable structure for a **Dashboard application**.  

The main goal was to create a **complete architecture** that supports clean code, high performance, and smooth developer collaboration — starting from an idea to a fully working project.
